# Quick Draw Sketchpad

## Description
<img align="right" height=350 width=450 src="/public/quick-draw-screenshot.jpg">
<p align="left">Quick Draw Sketchpad is an online drawing site where users can doodle to their heart's desire. Compatible with mouse and touch functionality on both desktop and mobile devices, users will be given a topic -- whether an animal, plant, place, etc. -- and will attempt to draw that thing to the best (or worst) of their ability.

This project idea came about while taking Google's Data Analytics Course through Coursera. Within one of the lessons, I was introduced to Google's <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data">Quick Draw</a> website and was instantly inspired by the _sheer magnitude_ of the operation. Now here we are, where I attempt to make my own version on a <b>much</b> smaller scale. No any additional libraries or frameworks were used; just plain, vanilla JavaScript and HTML5. The reason for this was simply to practice more with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. This was also my first time using the built-in Canvas API, which is responsible for the drawing functionality.</p>
